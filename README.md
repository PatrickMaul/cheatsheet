# Cheatsheet
This cheat sheet covers mostly web development (technologies, snippets, and other helpful stuff), Git, Docker, and something hardware related. Some resources are listed and some are described.

In addition, the range is constantly being expanded and updated.

As it is kept for private use only, we ask that you apologize and/or report anything that is invalid or outdated.
